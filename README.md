# Startpage

Obviously drawing inspiration from 
[r/startpages](https://xavier-pdl.github.io/startpage/). Simple startpage but it's
my startpage.

There are a few things that I'd like to add/change...

- Add some dynamic element/s. Possible ideas:
    - Clock
    - Weather
    - Quotes

Keep it simple, keep it clean.
