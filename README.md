# Startpage

Obviously drawing inspiration from 
[https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages/](r/startpages). Simple startpage but it's
my startpage.

There are a few things that I'd like to add/change...

- Add a search bar
- Set focus on page onload (for increased vimium efficiency)
- Background image (perhaps a few different ones)
- Make the links section slightly transparent
- Add some dynamic element/s. Possible ideas:
    - Clock
    - Weather
    - Quotes

Keep it simple, keep it clean.
